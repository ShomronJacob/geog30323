## Course recap

* Thus far: we've focused on _exploratory data analysis_, which involves data wrangling, summarization, and visualization
* Your data analysis journey shouldn't stop here!  Topics to consider: 
    * _Explanatory_ vs. exploratory visualization
    * Statistics and data science
    * Data ethics and "big data" (next week)

---

### Communicating with data

* Once you've done all of the hard work wrangling your data, you'll want to communicate insights to others!
* This might include: 
    * Polished data products or reports
    * Models that can scale your insights

---

### Explanatory visualization

* We've largely worked to this point with _exploratory visualization_, which refers to internally-facing visualizations that help us reveal insights about our data
* Often, externally-facing data products will include _explanatory visualization_, which include a polished design and emphasize one or two key points

---

### Interactive reports

* Example: a data journalism article - or your Jupyter Notebook!
* Key distinction: your code, data exploration, etc. will likely be external to the report (this can vary depending on the context, however)

---

### Tableau

<img src="http://s1.q4cdn.com/149179428/files/images/tableau_logo-optimized-2x.png">

* Highly popular software for data visualization - both exploratory and explanatory
* Intuitive, drag-and-drop interface
* Key feature: the _dashboard_

---


### Data dashboards

Examples: 

* Your Salary vs. an MLB Player's Salary: http://www.osmguy.com/2014/03/salary-vs-mlb-players-salary-visualization/
* Bay Area Bike Share: https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/30-minutes-bay-area-bike-share
* UN Population Data: http://dataremixed.com/2014/07/story-types-a-thought-starter/

---

### Demo: Tableau Public

* Let's work with a (cleaned) obesity dataset you'll be familiar with from earlier in the semester; download it at http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/data/overweight.csv

---

### Static vs. interactive

For discussion: 

* In what circumstances might a static plot be preferable to an interactive one? 
* What about the other way around?

## Data Science

* __Data science__: new(ish) field that has emerged to address the challenges of working with modern data
* Fuses statistics, computer science, visualization, graphic design, and the humanities/social sciences/natural sciences...

---

### The data analysis process

---

### Visualization vs. modeling

Hadley Wickham (paraphrased): 

> Visualization can surprise you, but it doesnâ€™t scale well.
> Modeling scales well, but it doesn't (fundamentally) surprise.

---

### Statistical modeling

* What is the mathematical relationship between an outcome variable $Y$ and one or more other "predictor" variables $X_{1}...X_{n}$?
* Recall our use of `lmplot` in `seaborn` - `lm` stands for _linear model_

---

### Statistical modeling

The linear model: 

$$ Y = Xb + e $$

where $Y$ represents the outcome variable, $X$ is a matrix of predictors, $b$ represents the "parameters", and $e$ represents the errors, or "residuals"

* Linear models will not always be appropriate for modeling relationships between variables!

---

### Statistics in Python

* Substantial statistical functionality available in the `statsmodels` package, which installs with Anaconda

---

### Statistics in Python

Let's get an example ready: 

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_context('notebook')
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
%matplotlib inline

df = pd.read_csv('http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/data/texas_colleges.csv')
df['grad_rate'] = df.grad_rate * 100


```

---

### Linear regression

```
f = smf.ols(formula = 'median_earn ~ grad_rate', data = df).fit()

f.summary()
```

---

### Multiple regression

```
f2 = smf.ols(formula = 'median_earn ~ grad_rate + sat_avg', data = df).fit()
f2.summary()
```
---

### Residuals and fitted values

```python
df['fitted'] = f2.predict()
df['resid'] = f2.resid

```

---

### Residuals and fitted values

```python
import cufflinks as cf
import plotly.plotly as py

py.sign_in('username', 'api_key')

df.iplot(x = 'fitted', y = 'resid', kind = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', 
        text = 'instnm', zerolinecolor = 'red', color = 'blue', 
        xTitle = 'Fitted values', yTitle = 'Residuals')

```

### Machine learning

* "The science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed"
* Types of machine learning algorithms: _supervised_ and _unsupervised_
* Topics in machine learning: _classification_, _clustering_, _regression_

Visual introduction to machine learning: http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/

---

### In Python: `scikit-learn`

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

df = pd.read_csv('http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/data/dec8.csv', index_col = 'name')

df.head()
```

---

### Example: K-means clustering

```python
np.random.seed(1983)

km = KMeans(n_clusters = 7).fit(df)

df['clusters'] = km.labels_

# Check TCU's cluster
df.ix['Texas Christian University'] 

```

---

### Example: nearest-neighbor search

```python
neigh = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors = 5)

# "Training" the model
neigh.fit(df) 

# Searching for neighbors
model = neigh.kneighbors(df, return_distance = False)
results = pd.DataFrame(model, columns = ['x1', 'x2', 'x3', 'x4', 'x5'])
merged = pd.merge(df.reset_index(), results, right_index = True, left_index = True)
```

---

### Example: nearest-neighbor search

```python
from ipywidgets import interact

def find_neighbors(university): 
    d = merged[merged.name == university].reset_index()
    for x in ['x2', 'x3', 'x4', 'x5']: 
        idx = d.iloc[0][x]
        m = merged.ix[idx]
        print(m['name'])

interact(find_neighbors, university = 'Texas Christian University')
```

### How to learn more

* Take statistics and machine learning courses here at TCU!
* Alternatively: [Coursera's Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhudatascience) is a great place to start...
