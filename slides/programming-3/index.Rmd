## Python refresher

* Exercise: write a function that takes the sum of two numbers and returns that sum divided by 3
* Discussion question: what is a _module_ in Python?  

---

## Iteration

## Iteration

* At your jobs, you will often need to repeat the same task over and over!
* From your textbook: "Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly."
* Solution: make the computer do it with _iteration_

---

## Loops

* Loops are operators that tell the computer to repeat an action a given number of times
* Common loops: 
    - `for`: Repeats an action over a series of items
    - `while`: Repeats an action until a given condition is satisfied

* Important note: loops, like functions, must obey whitespace rules!

---

## The `for` loop

* `for` repeats an action __for__ every element in an object
* Example: 

```python
>>> for character in 'Kyle': 
...   print("Give me a " + character + "!")
... 
Give me a K!
Give me a y!
Give me a l!
Give me a e!
```

---

### How `for` works

So what is going on here?  

1. The `for` loop looks at what it will iterate through - in this case it is a string, `Kyle`
2. We are referring to each element of our string, `Kyle`, as `character`.  
3. The loop evaluates the expression passed to the `print` function __for__ each `character` in `Kyle` successively

So the `for` loop is equivalent to: 

```python
print("Give me a K!")
print("Give me a y!")
print("Give me a l!")
print("Give me a e!")
```

---

### The `while` loop

* `while` repeats an action until a given condition is satisfied
* Example: 

```python
In [1]: i = 5
   ...: 
   ...: while i > 0: 
   ...:     print(str(i) + "...")
   ...:     i = i - 1
   ...: 
   ...: print("Blast-off!")
5...
4...
3...
2...
1...
Blast-off!
```

---

### How `while` works

1. We define a counter, `i`, that we set to 5 before running the loop
2. __While__ the value of `i` is greater than `0`, we tell Python to evaluate the `print` function
3. With each run of the loop, we subtract `1` from `i`
4. When `i` is equal to `0`, we exit the loop and print `"Blast-off"` to the console

Beware of the infinite `while` loop!

---

## Conditional logic

* However - what if we don't want to do the same thing every time we run a loop?  Or a function, for that matter? 
* Answer: __conditional logic__
* Conditional operators in Python: 
    - `if`
    - `elif`
    - `else`

---

### Conditional logic in Python

* Example: 

```python
>>> mylist = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
>>> for number in mylist: 
...     if number > 7: 
...         print(str(number) + " is greater than 7!")
...     else: 
...         print(str(number) + " is less than 7!")
... 
2 is less than 7!
4 is less than 7!
6 is less than 7!
8 is greater than 7!
10 is greater than 7!
12 is greater than 7!
```

---

### Conditional logic in functions

* When writing functions, you'll rely heavily on conditional statements 

```python
def is_even(x): 
    if x % 2 == 0: 
        return(True)
    else: 
        return(False)

>>> is_even(8)
True
>>> is_even(99)
False
```
