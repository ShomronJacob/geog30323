    "## Geography 30323: Take-home exam #2\n",
    "\n",
    "This second take home exam will continue to evaluate your skills in using Python for data analysis, with a focus on data wrangling and data visualization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The examination consists of a series of structured and semi-structured questions that you will answer with data analysis. In this examination, you will answer a series of questions which pertain to two different datasets I've provided for you. There is a total possible score of 100; your scores will then be weighted as this take-home examination constitutes 15 percent of your overall course grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your responses to the following questions should consist of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code used to answer the question, and any results you've produced;\n",
    "2. Visualizations, when appropriate;\n",
    "3. A short write-up in Markdown explaining what you did, and analyzing/interpreting your results when appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responses that receive 80% credit and up will show evidence of effort beyond the minimum necessary to answer the question. This could include but is not limited to noticeable thoughtfulness in the interpretation of the data; responses that blend computation, visualization, and description quite well; or evidence of going beyond the basic parameters of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This examination should be completed in this Jupyter Notebook, like your weekly assignments. It is due by the end of the day on __Tuesday, November 24__ for full credit, and will incur a 10 percent penalty (equivalent to 1.5 percent of your overall grade for the semester!) for each day it is submitted past the deadline.\n",

    "This exam is more open-ended than Exam 1 - so take care with your responses!"
